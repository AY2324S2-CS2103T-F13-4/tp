<h3 id="project-addressbook-level-3">Project: AddressBook Level 3</h3>

<p>AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.</p>

<p>Given below are my contributions to the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New Feature</strong>: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    <ul>
      <li>What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.</li>
      <li>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.</li>
      <li>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.</li>
      <li>Credits: <em>{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Feature</strong>: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.</p>
