# Project: ClassMonitor

ClassMonitor is a **desktop app for managing student performances, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClassMonitor can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to give stars to students for class participation.
  * What it does: allows the user to give students a defined number of stars for class participation. Users can also edit the number of stars directly using the `edit` method.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user (teaching assistant) can now track the performance of students in class, using the number of stars as a gauge for a student's engagement in class.
  * Highlights: This enhancement introduces a new field under student which diverges from the design of other fields like `name` or `phone number`, which are replaced upon edit, however, we allow for replacement of value via `edit`, as well as accumulation of stars using `star`. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required proper exception handling to isolate the changes made to the number of stars by `star` and `edit` commands.
  * Credits: *There is partial use of AB3 code. I was compelled to use the AB3 code design to ensure coherence of code for my parser and command classes.*
